This is the landing page for business. The site is fully responsive for tablets and mobile devices. When you click on the buttons there is a popup opening with a feedback form. The slick-slider library is connected to implement sliders on the page. The form is customized using formstyler. In the mobile version there is a drop-down burger menu. In the layout I used the scss preprocessor and flexbox. At the bottom of the site is a Google map
